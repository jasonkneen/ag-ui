 * with multimodal blocks" — measured 2026-08-25 on `@langchain/openai@1.2.0`), so
 * the document path this converter claims to support has to carry one or it is
 * not actually supported.
 *
 * Python does not throw, and does not merely drop the key either: measured on
 * `langchain-core@1.2.13`, a nameless file block warns ("OpenAI may require a
 * filename for file uploads…") and the part goes out carrying the PLACEHOLDER
 * `filename: "LC_AUTOGENERATED"` — i.e. the provider is told the user attached a
 * file by that name. Substituting a derived name is an improvement on both.
 *
 * The two runtimes do NOT emit the same block: this one emits
 * `source_type` / `data` / `mime_type` / `metadata.filename`, the Python adapter
 * emits `base64` / `mime_type` / top-level `filename`. Both run the same
 * derivation — `_derive_filename` there is kept identical to this — so an
 * attachment gets the same name whichever runtime sent it.
 *
 * THE TWO BLOCKS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. An earlier revision of this paragraph
 * said they were — "both translate to the same provider part (verified through
 * both real translators)" — and only three of the four combinations hold.
 * Measured 2026-08-25 with an `application/pdf` file block, on
 * `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` + `@langchain/core@1.1.40` (through `ChatOpenAI` with
 * a stub `fetch`) and `langchain-core@1.2.13` (through
 * `convert_to_openai_messages`):
 *
 *   block emitted by   JS translator            Python translator
 *   -----------------  -----------------------  -----------------------

 *   the Python adapter FORWARDED VERBATIM ✗     file.file_data ✓
 *                      (reaches the provider    + file.filename

 *                      …, "filename": …}`, with
 *                      no throw and no warning)
 *
 * The failing cell is the direction that does not occur. JS gates translation on
 * `isDataContentBlock`, which tests `source_type` and nothing else, and the
 * Python adapter never emits that key — the same trap {@link StandardMediaBlock}
 * documents for the JS-native shape. It stays LATENT because neither adapter's
 * output crosses into the other's translator, and for asymmetric reasons:
 *
 *   - This package drives a LangGraph SERVER over `@langchain/langgraph-sdk`,
 *     and that server is usually the Python one. Its blocks therefore have to
 *     translate in BOTH columns — which is exactly why row 1 is measured in both
 *     and why {@link StandardMediaBlock} picks the shape it picks.
 *   - The Python adapter's `LangGraphAgent` takes an IN-PROCESS
 *     `CompiledStateGraph`, not a remote deployment, so a block it emits is only
 *     ever handed to langchain-core Python — row 2's ✓ cell. Nothing in either
 *     package routes row 2 into the JS column.
 *
 * So the surviving claim is the narrower one: each block produces the same
 * provider part through the translator its own runtime actually reaches, and
 * this adapter's block additionally survives the other runtime's. Revisit if the
 * Python adapter ever grows a remote-server transport.
 *
 * THE SUBTYPE IS NOT THE EXTENSION. It coincides with one often enough to look
 * like a rule — `application/pdf`, `text/csv` — and then does not:
 * `text/plain` is not `.plain`, `audio/mpeg` is not `.mpeg`, and
 * `application/vnd.api+json` is not `.vnd.api`. So the subtype is a LAST resort
 * here, taken only when it survives being checked:
 *
 *   1. {@link FILENAME_EXTENSIONS} answers the types whose subtype is wrong.
 *   2. A structured-syntax suffix (RFC 6838 §4.2.8) names the underlying
 *      format, so `+json` / `+xml` wins over the vendor tree in front of it.
 *   3. Otherwise the registration-tree prefix (`vnd.`, `prs.`, `x-`, `x.`) is
 *      stripped, because it is a namespace and not part of any extension.
 *   4. What is left has to LOOK like an extension. `ms-excel` and
 *      `openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` do not, and a
 *      dot inside the "extension" turns `attachment.vnd.ms-excel` into a file
 *      apparently named `attachment.vnd`. Anything implausible becomes `.bin`,
 *      which is what an unidentified byte stream is called.
 *
 * MIME types are case-insensitive (RFC 2045 §5.1), so the lookup is case-folded.

 *   JS native (data/mimeType/metadata)       VERBATIM ✗           VERBATIM ✗
 *
 * "VERBATIM" is the trap. The block is neither translated nor rejected: it is
 * forwarded to the provider exactly as written, so the request carries a content
 * part the API does not accept. It is the failure mode in BOTH runtimes for a
 * shape that runtime does not recognise — the JS-native block came back out of
 * `convert_to_openai_messages` as `{"type": "file", "data": …, "mimeType": …,
 * "metadata": {…}}`, unchanged, with no exception and no warning. (An earlier
 * revision of this table claimed Python raised a `ValueError` on that row. It
 * does not, on 1.2.13 — silence is the actual behaviour, and it is worse.)
 *
 * On the JS side the cause is that the default conversion path gates translation
 * behind `isDataContentBlock`, which requires a `source_type` of `"url"` /
 * `"base64"` / `"text"` / `"id"`; a block without that key is not recognised as
 * media at all.
 *
 * `@langchain/core` does mark this family `@deprecated` ("Use
 * {@link ContentBlock.Multimodal.Data} instead" — the literal JSDoc in
 * `dist/messages/content/data.d.ts`), and the JS-native shape it points to
 * works — but ONLY on the v1 conversion path, which requires
 * `response_metadata.output_version === "v1"` on the message. This adapter does
 * not set that marker and cannot set it for a graph it does not own, so on the
 * path that actually runs, the non-deprecated shape is the one that silently
 * fails. The deprecated family costs nothing for staying: measured, it translates
 * to `file.file_data` on the v1 path too. Deprecated-and-translated beats
 * current-and-forwarded-raw.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, measured and deliberately not addressed here: the Responses API.
 * Everything above is Chat Completions, which is where the reported failure was.
 * On `useResponsesApi: true` the same emitted block behaves differently, and no
 * single shape fixes both — the JS-native shape is correct on Responses/v1 and
 * forwarded raw on the Chat Completions default path, which is the bug this
 * change exists to fix. Measured 2026-08-25 on `@langchain/openai@1.2.0`, before
 * and after, reading the request body off a stub `fetch`:
 *
 *   case                          before                     after

 *
 * Note row 3's "before": on Chat Completions the old `image_url` block stayed an
 * `image_url` part. `input_image` is the RESPONSES spelling of the same mistake,
 * so only the Responses rows show it.
 *
 * Row 3 is two cases (default and v1), so the table covers six. Five of them go
 * from a wrong-kind part to a right-kind one. Row 1 goes the other way, and it is
 * the one to know about: the attachment stops being emitted at all, with no throw
 * and no warning, so the model answers without ever seeing it. The cause is
 * upstream and not reachable from here — `dist/converters/responses.js` handles
 * the v1 block kinds in one chain and audio's branch is empty
 * (`} else if (block.type === "audio") {}`), the only occurrence of "audio"
 * anywhere in that converter, sitting immediately before the `file`, `image` and
 * `video` branches, each of which resolves a real part.
 *
 * Note what row 1 is NOT: a working path that this change broke. Before, the
 * audio went out labelled as an image, so the request carried a part the API
 * does not accept for audio. The run failed then and produces a wrong answer now
 * — worse to diagnose, but not a lost capability.
 *
 * This converter cannot tell the two transports apart. It receives messages and
 * nothing else; the model is constructed inside the graph, on the far side of the
 * LangGraph server call. Emitting per-transport is not possible from here.
 *
 * Revisit when the JS default path translates native blocks without a marker, or
 * when the Responses v1 converter grows an audio branch. Neither has happened as
 * of `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` / `@langchain/core@1.1.40`, re-checked 2026-08-25:
 * a native block is still forwarded raw on the default path, and the audio branch
 * in `dist/converters/responses.js` is still empty.

 *      `Dropping `. A vanished attachment with no string to search for is the
 *      failure an operator cannot diagnose. This covers the drops that have no
 *      branch of their own: an item of an UNRECOGNISED TYPE is a drop too, and
 *      says so.
 *   3. ONE BAD ITEM COSTS ONLY ITSELF. The items on either side of it in the
 *      same content array, and every other message in the list, still convert.
 *
 * All three are checkable from outside: for ANY input, each converter returns an
 * array, emits one warning per dropped item, and the surviving items are exactly
 * what the same input minus the bad item would have produced.

 * The Python adapter carries this same block above
