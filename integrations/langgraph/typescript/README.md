# @ag-ui/langgraph

Implementation of the AG-UI protocol for LangGraph.

Connects LangGraph graphs to frontend applications via the AG-UI protocol. Supports both local TypeScript graphs and remote LangGraph Cloud deployments with full state management and interrupt handling.

## Media inputs

Audio and document attachments keep their LangChain content type: audio becomes
`audio`, and documents become `file`. Inline bytes, base64 data URLs, and remote
URLs retain their payload and supplied filename; the adapter does not fetch URLs.
Images and videos retain their existing `image_url` representation. For inline
video, the data URL preserves the video MIME type and bytes so existing Gemini
translation continues to work. Video filename and history modality preservation
remain limited by this compatibility representation.

Conversion does not imply model support. The graph's provider, model, and API
must support the supplied media type and source. Provider rejections are reported
as a `RUN_ERROR`. Existing inline WAV/MP3 MIME aliases are normalized for
compatibility, while other audio MIME types remain unchanged. Provider file
handles remain unsupported and are skipped with a warning.

## Run errors

Graph/provider and stream failures are delivered as a terminal `RUN_ERROR`
event, followed by stream completion without `RUN_FINISHED`. This also applies
to text-only runs.

When using `runAgent()`, handle these failures in `onRunErrorEvent`. When
subscribing to `run()`, inspect the emitted `RUN_ERROR` event. These producer
failures no longer reject the `runAgent()` promise or invoke the Observable's
`error` callback. Consumer and client-side validation failures retain their
existing error behavior.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ag-ui/langgraph
pnpm add @ag-ui/langgraph
yarn add @ag-ui/langgraph
```

## Usage

```ts
import { LangGraphAgent } from "@ag-ui/langgraph";

// Create an AG-UI compatible agent
const agent = new LangGraphAgent({
  graphId: "my-graph",
  deploymentUrl: "https://your-langgraph-deployment.com",
  langsmithApiKey: "your-api-key",
});

// Run with streaming
const result = await agent.runAgent({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Start the workflow" }],
});
```

## Features

- **Cloud & local support** – Works with LangGraph Cloud and local graph instances
- **State management** – Bidirectional state synchronization with graph nodes
- **Interrupt handling** – Human-in-the-loop workflow support
- **Step tracking** – Real-time node execution progress

## Resuming via AG-UI standard `resume[]`

When a client uses `RunAgentInput.resume = [ResumeEntry, ...]` instead of
the legacy `forwardedProps.command.resume`, the integration converts the
array into a single `Command(resume=...)` value (LangGraph's resume
channel is per-task, not per-interrupt). The shape your graph receives:

- **Single `resolved` entry** → `interrupt()` returns `entry.payload`
  verbatim. Existing graphs that consumed `Command(resume=<payload>)`
  keep working.
- **Single `cancelled` entry** → `interrupt()` returns the sentinel
  `{"__agui_cancelled__": true, "interrupt_id": "..."}`.
  Your graph should branch on this key.
- **Multiple entries** (parallel interrupts) → `interrupt()` returns
  `{"__agui_resume_map__": { interruptId: {status, payload}, ... }}`.

These sentinels live in the AG-UI integration only — they do **not**
leak into transport-level events.

## Migrating to AG-UI standard interrupts

The LangGraph integration now supports the AG-UI standard interrupt protocol. Key changes:

### Detecting a paused run

When the structured outcome is enabled (`emitInterruptOutcome: true`, opt-in — see the callout below), `RunFinishedEvent.outcome.type === "interrupt"` is the canonical signal that a run has paused for human input. The `outcome.interrupts` array contains AG-UI `Interrupt` objects with `id`, `reason`, `message`, `toolCallId`, `responseSchema`, `expiresAt`, and `metadata` fields. LangGraph-specific data (raw interrupt value, `ns`, `resumable`, `when`) is preserved under `metadata.langgraph`.

```ts
// New: read interrupts from outcome
if (event.type === "RUN_FINISHED" && event.outcome?.type === "interrupt") {
  for (const interrupt of event.outcome.interrupts) {
    console.log(interrupt.id, interrupt.reason, interrupt.message);
  }
}
```

> **Opt-in (`emitInterruptOutcome`, default `false`).** The structured
> `outcome` is only emitted when you enable it. Released clients that resume
> through the legacy `forwardedProps.command.resume` channel (e.g. CopilotKit's
> `useLangGraphInterrupt`, as of v1.60.x) **stop sending a resume directive once
> they observe the structured outcome**, which strands the run — so it stays
> opt-in until those clients adopt `RunAgentInput.resume[]`. With the default,
> interrupted runs end with a plain `RUN_FINISHED` plus the legacy
> `on_interrupt` event, exactly as before. Enable the canonical outcome once
> your client reads `RunAgentInput.resume[]`:
>
> ```ts
> const agent = new LangGraphAgent({
>   graphId: "my-graph",
>   deploymentUrl: "https://your-langgraph-deployment.com",
>   emitInterruptOutcome: true,
> });
> ```

### Resuming a run

Send `RunAgentInput.resume` (recommended) instead of `forwardedProps.command.resume`:

```ts
// New (recommended)
const input = {
  threadId: "t1",
  runId: "r2",
  messages: [],
  resume: [
    { interruptId: "int-abc", status: "resolved", payload: { approved: true } },
  ],
};

// Old (still works, but deprecated)
const input = {
  threadId: "t1",
  runId: "r2",
  messages: [],
  forwardedProps: { command: { resume: { approved: true } } },
};
```

If both `input.resume` and `forwardedProps.command.resume` are provided, `input.resume` takes precedence and a warning is logged.

### Legacy `on_interrupt` custom event

By default the integration emits `CustomEvent(name="on_interrupt")` for backward compatibility (and, when `emitInterruptOutcome` is enabled, alongside the new `RunFinishedEvent.outcome`). To suppress the legacy event:

```ts
const agent = new LangGraphAgent({
  graphId: "my-graph",
  deploymentUrl: "https://your-langgraph-deployment.com",
  langsmithApiKey: "your-api-key",
  enableLegacyOnInterruptEvent: false,
});
```

Disabling the legacy event forces `emitInterruptOutcome` on (even if left `false`): with both off, an interrupt would be surfaced by neither channel, so the structured outcome is emitted to avoid silently stranding the run.

Consumers should migrate to reading `outcome` from `RunFinishedEvent` rather than listening for `CustomEvent(name="on_interrupt")`.

### Capabilities

`LangGraphAgent.getCapabilities()` returns `humanInTheLoop: { supported: true, interrupts: true, approveWithEdits: true }`.

### Customising the HITL bridge (subclass hooks)

If your graph uses a middleware whose interrupt value carries structured payloads (e.g. LangChain's `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware` with `action_requests` / `review_configs`), you can override two protected methods instead of monkey-patching the run loop:

```ts
import { LangGraphAgent, langGraphInterruptToAGUI } from "@ag-ui/langgraph";
import type { Interrupt as AGUIInterrupt, ResumeEntry } from "@ag-ui/core";
import type { Interrupt as LangGraphInterrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph-sdk";

class HITLLangGraphAgent extends LangGraphAgent {
  protected interruptsToAGUI(
    list: readonly LangGraphInterrupt[],
  ): AGUIInterrupt[] {
    const out: AGUIInterrupt[] = [];
    for (const lg of list) {
      const value = lg.value;
      if (
        typeof value === "object" &&
        value !== null &&
        "action_requests" in value
      ) {
        out.push(...myActionRequestsToAGUI(value));
      } else {
        out.push(langGraphInterruptToAGUI(lg));
      }
    }
    return out;
  }

  protected buildCommandResumeFromAgui(
    entries: readonly ResumeEntry[],
    ctx: { openInterrupts: AGUIInterrupt[] },
  ): unknown {
    return myResumeToDecisions(entries, ctx.openInterrupts);
  }
}
```

The base class still handles `STATE_SNAPSHOT` / `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` ordering, legacy `CustomEvent(on_interrupt)` emission, the `prepareStream` short-circuit, and `forwardedProps.command.resume` deprecation — your subclass only needs to care about the HITL-specific translation.
