"""The OpenAI Responses stream-event vocabulary this bridge reads.

One home for two facts that must never disagree: WHICH Responses stream event
types the bridge consumes, and WHAT it consumes each one for. The second fact is
what decides the cost of losing an event, so both decisions that depend on it
derive from the roles here rather than from a list kept next to the decision:

* ``_responses.iter_responses_events`` decides from the role whether an event
  that failed to parse can be skipped or has to be reported.
* ``_capabilities`` decides from the role which types the installed litellm MUST
  be able to model for the channel to be declared available at all.

``tests/test_reasoning.py`` walks the driver's own source and asserts that every
event type it branches on has a role here (and that every non-envelope role here
is branched on), so this map cannot drift away from the code it describes.

The roles, and what losing one event of each costs:

``ENVELOPE``
    Stream bookkeeping: ``response.created`` (the turn's id / model / timestamp,
    each of which has a fallback -- the assistant message id falls back to the
    output item's own id) and ``response.in_progress`` (which the driver does not
    read at all). Losing one costs nothing this bridge maps.
``REASONING``
    A reasoning-summary text delta. Losing ONE leaves a gap in a trace while the
    answer and the outcome stay intact, so it is not fatal. A litellm that cannot
    model them AT ALL is different: it defeats the only reason this channel
    exists, so these types are required for the channel to be available.
``ENRICHMENT``
    ``response.output_item.done``, read for the OPTIONAL encrypted-reasoning blob
    (present only when the caller asked for
    ``include=["reasoning.encrypted_content"]``). Nothing else rides it.
``PAYLOAD``
    Answer text, a tool call's identity, a tool call's argument deltas. Losing
    one drops answer text or truncates arguments to invalid JSON while the turn
    still reports success, so nothing downstream can tell content went missing.
``TERMINAL``
    The stream's outcome. Losing one turns a failed stream into an empty
    assistant message with no failure recorded and no RUN_ERROR.

This module is a LEAF: it imports only the stdlib, so ``_capabilities`` /
``_reasoning`` / ``_responses`` can all import it at module-load time without a
circular dependency.
