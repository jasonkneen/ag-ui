    Used in the ``finally`` block of the event generators so that a client
    disconnect (which closes the generator) tears down the kickoff coroutine
    instead of leaking it.

    Semantics:
    - A SINGLE shared monotonic deadline (``_cancel_join_timeout_seconds``)
      bounds the combined wait of (grace window + force-cancel join +
      outer-cancel recovery). There is one ceiling window for the entire
      teardown, not three.
    - If ``allow_grace`` and the task is mid-flight on a happy path, wait up
      to ``min(_CANCEL_GRACE_SECONDS, remaining-budget)`` for it to finish
      on its own (the FlowFinishedEvent listener enqueues ``None``
      microseconds before ``kickoff_async`` actually returns). A quick
      ``sleep(0)`` + ``task.done()`` probe fast-paths the common case where
      the task is microseconds from returning, so happy-path requests do
      NOT systematically pay the 1s grace latency tax.
    - The grace wait is SHIELDED and protected by the same outer-cancel
      recovery pattern used post-grace. If the caller is cancelled during
      the grace wait, ``task.cancel()`` still fires via the ``finally`` and
      the task is cleanly unwound within the remaining budget; we don't
      leave a cancelled-but-unjoined task behind.
    - We deliberately do NOT catch ``BaseException``. ``SystemExit`` /
      ``KeyboardInterrupt`` / ``CancelledError`` must propagate; we only
      swallow ``TimeoutError`` (explicitly) and recoverable ``Exception``
      subclasses from the task itself.
    - On Python 3.11+, catching ``CancelledError`` does NOT decrement
      ``Task.cancelling()``: any subsequent ``await`` re-raises immediately
      unless we call ``asyncio.current_task().uncancel()``. Without that,
      the bounded recovery wait in the CancelledError branch is defeated
      (re-raises on entry). We invoke ``uncancel`` via ``getattr`` so the

    ``QUEUES_LOCK`` is intentionally NOT taken here.

    Contract:
    * ``QUEUES`` is a plain ``dict`` keyed by the per-flow UUID hex stored on
      the flow as ``_agui_queue_key``. CPython's GIL makes ``dict.get(k)``
      atomic at the bytecode level — we cannot observe a half-constructed
      mapping. This assumes a CPython-with-GIL interpreter; free-threaded
      CPython 3.13+ (PEP 703, opt-in ``--disable-gil``) removes that
      bytecode-atomicity guarantee and would require wrapping the read in a
      ``threading.Lock`` (or a thread-safe mapping). Forward-compat note only —
      the module does not ship free-thread support today.
    * Threading model: crewai's ``CrewAIEventsBus`` emits listener callbacks
      synchronously from whatever call stack raised the event. Our events are
      raised from within ``kickoff_async`` — which we ``await`` on the event
      loop — so in practice every listener callback fires on the loop thread
      and ``put_nowait`` is the right primitive. If crewai ever invokes the
      bus from a worker thread (a future background-executor feature), every
      ``put_nowait`` call site in
      ``FastAPICrewFlowEventListener.setup_listeners`` must be revisited and
      converted to ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe``.
    * This function is called from TWO contexts:
      (a) Synchronous crewai event-listener callbacks. Those run on the event
          loop thread but via synchronous call stacks where we cannot
          ``await`` — hence no ``QUEUES_LOCK`` acquisition.
      (b) The async endpoint code paths, which always take ``QUEUES_LOCK`` for
          writes (``create_queue``, ``delete_queue``) but not reads.
    * The one race that remains is SEMANTIC rather than data-structural: a
      late listener callback that fires after ``delete_queue`` removed the
      entry observes ``None`` and silently no-ops. This is intended — an event
      for a torn-down flow has nowhere to land. ``_cancel_and_join`` teardown
      widens the window during which late callbacks can arrive after delete
      but does not change the semantics.
    * A flow that was never registered with ``create_queue`` will not carry
      the ``_agui_queue_key`` attribute; we default to ``None`` and the
      ``get`` returns ``None`` as intended.

                This is an ``async def`` generator (``yield``s encoded
                frames); it does NOT return a boolean. Callers iterate with
                ``async for`` and rely on their outer control flow to decide
                what happens after the drain. An empty iteration means either
                (a) the ``None`` sentinel was consumed or (b) the queue
                quiesced within the drain budget.

                Algorithm:
                * Each pass drains any currently-queued items via non-blocking
                  ``get_nowait``. If the ``None`` sentinel appears we stop
                  immediately.
                * After each pass we yield one scheduler tick
                  (``asyncio.sleep(0)``) — UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of
                  whether the pass drained anything — so any ``call_soon`` /
                  ``call_later(0)`` chained by a listener has a chance to run
                  before we probe again.
                * We loop up to ``_DRAIN_MAX_PASSES`` passes or until the
                  cumulative ``_DRAIN_BUDGET_SECONDS`` wall clock is exhausted
                  — whichever comes first. This covers listener chains that
                  need multiple scheduler ticks to materialise their enqueue
                  (e.g. a listener callback that itself schedules another
                  ``call_soon``). A single-tick early-return would drop
                  late-arriving items needing more than one ``sleep(0)`` tick.
                * Budget-exhaustion mid-pass is logged at DEBUG so operators
                  can correlate dropped events; the hard pass cap is likewise
                  logged so a pathological listener that keeps enqueueing

    crewai enqueues its end sentinel only AFTER ``kickoff_async`` fully returns —
    result recorded, trace batch finalized — see ``create_async_frame_generator``
    in crewai's ``utilities/streaming.py``: the ``flow_finished`` FRAME is emitted
    from inside ``kickoff_async``, but the ``None`` that ends the iterator lands
    only in the run task's ``finally``, one or more loop turns later.

    If the driver ``break``s the instant RUN_FINISHED is emitted and lets the
    ``finally`` ``aclose()`` the session, crewai's frame generator is
    ``GeneratorExit``-ed at its ``yield`` and its OWN ``finally`` ``task.cancel()``s
    the still-finalizing kickoff task — on EVERY happy-path run (verified against
    the 1.15.7 wheel: the session ends ``is_cancelled=True`` with no ``result``).
    Draining to natural ``StopAsyncIteration`` instead lets the run task reach its
    end sentinel, so the subsequent ``aclose()`` is a no-op and the kickoff is
    never cancelled mid-finalization. This is the frame-path analogue of the
    legacy path's ``_cancel_and_join(allow_grace=True)`` happy-path window.

    events.

    The behavior-preserving replacement for ``_run_flow_event_stream`` on crewai
    >= 1.6. Instead of a process-global bus listener enqueuing onto a per-flow
    ``asyncio.Queue`` (keyed by a uuid stamped on the Flow), we consume the
    ordered ``StreamFrame`` envelopes crewai's scoped stream sink produces and
    map them through the single ``StreamFrameTranslator`` seam.

    Every must-survive behavior of the legacy path is preserved by REUSING the
    same helpers:

    * the four-code RUN_ERROR taxonomy (``AGUI_CREWAI_FLOW_TIMEOUT`` /
      ``AGUI_CREWAI_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`` / ``AGUI_CREWAI_FLOW_ERROR_<Class>``) via
      ``_CeilingExceeded`` / ``_format_timeout_message`` / ``_sanitize_exception_code``;
    * the wall-clock ceiling + env knobs (``timeout`` is ``_flow_timeout_seconds()``);
    * ``_stamp_correlation_ids`` on every emitted event and
      ``_run_error_extras`` (camelCase wire aliases) on every RUN_ERROR;
    * client-disconnect teardown via ``aclose()`` (see ``_aclose_stream_session``).

    ``flow_context`` is set so the ``sdk.copilotkit_*`` helpers can emit their
    ``Bridged*`` events; those reach the scoped sink synchronously because
    ``event_bus._prepare_event`` calls ``publish_stream_event`` on every
    ``emit``.

    Payload + identity come from the RAW event, not ``frame.data``. We register
    our OWN scoped sink that parks the raw event object keyed by
    ``event.event_id`` — but ONLY when ``source is flow_copy``, so a nested
    ``crew.kickoff``'s own flow's lifecycle/method
    events (which leak onto this same sink via the copied contextvars) are
    excluded. The frame stream then supplies ORDERING; for each frame we look
    up the parked raw event by ``frame.id`` and translate it. A frame with no
    parked event belonged to a nested flow (or is a crewai-internal frame we
    drop) and is skipped. This mirrors the legacy listener's ``source is
    flow_copy`` gate and its pristine-payload behavior.

    Because ``publish_stream_event`` runs the sink synchronously on ``emit``
    and crewai enqueues the frame via ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` (a later
    loop turn), the raw event is ALWAYS parked before its frame is dequeued.
