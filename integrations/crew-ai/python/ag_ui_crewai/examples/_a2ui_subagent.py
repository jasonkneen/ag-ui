"""Shared subagent-driven A2UI turn for the dynamic-schema and recovery demos.

Both demos are plain agentic-chat flows with no A2UI tool wired: the frontend
a2ui middleware forwards ``injectA2UITool`` and the adapter auto-injects
``generate_a2ui``, which designs surfaces against the dojo's dynamic catalog and
validates/retries each one. The two feature flows differ only in name; recovery
is inherent to the toolkit loop, so they share this turn.

COMPOSITION_GUIDE = """
## Available Pre-made Components

The catalog has EXACTLY four components: Row, HotelCard, ProductCard,
TeamMemberCard. Use ONLY these. Do NOT use Column, Text, Card, Container, List,
Stack, or any other component - they are not in the catalog and the renderer
rejects them with "Unknown component".

### Row  (the ONLY layout container; must be the root)
Repeats a card template per item via structural children:
  {"id":"root","component":"Row","children":{"componentId":"card","path":"/items"}}

### HotelCard
Props: name, location, rating (number 0-5), pricePerNight, action

### ProductCard
Props: name, price, rating (number 0-5), description (optional), action

### TeamMemberCard
Props: name, role, department (optional), email (optional), action

## RULES
- The root component MUST have id "root" and component "Row". Do NOT wrap it in
  a Column or any other component - Row is the top-level container itself.
- Root is ALWAYS: {"id":"root","component":"Row","children":{"componentId":"<card-id>","path":"/items"}}
- ALWAYS include the referenced card component in the components array.
- Inside templates use RELATIVE paths (no leading slash): {"path":"name"}.
- Always provide data in the "data" argument as {"items":[...]}.
- Pick the ONE card type that best matches the request; generate 3-4 realistic items.
- The components array contains EXACTLY two entries: the root Row and the card.
