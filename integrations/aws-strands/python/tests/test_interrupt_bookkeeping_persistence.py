"""Regression coverage for interrupt bookkeeping surviving a process restart.

``_pending_interrupts_by_thread`` and ``_last_resume_fingerprint`` are the
adapter's own bookkeeping, layered on top of Strands' native
``_interrupt_state`` (which SessionManager already persists/restores on its
own). Prior to this, the adapter's bookkeeping lived purely in a Python dict
on the ``StrandsAgent`` instance, so a real process restart lost it:

- Rule 6 (responseSchema payload validation) and Rule 7 (expiresAt
  enforcement) silently degrade, since they read AG-UI-specific interrupt
  metadata that only exists in this bookkeeping.
- Rule 5 (idempotency) breaks: a replayed resume request is no longer
  recognized as a duplicate and can re-invoke the model/tool.

These tests use a REAL ``strands.agent.state.AgentState`` instance (not a
mock) to prove the adapter actually round-trips through
``strands_agent.state``, matching what a real SessionManager restores after
a restart.
