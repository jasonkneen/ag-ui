"""Tests that every Strands Agent __init__ param round-trips to per-thread instances.

Driven by inspect.signature so new Strands params are covered automatically.

Two rules keep this suite honest, both learned the hard way:

* It never skips. A param this suite cannot exercise is a param that would be
  dropped in production without anyone noticing, so an unexercisable param
  fails here instead. The previous version skipped whenever the template
  rejected its sentinel, and that skip is what hid a silently-dropped param
  through several Strands releases.
* It never narrows to a fixed list of params. Discovery off the constructor
  signature is the only reason the gap was ever found; a curated list would
  only ever cover the params someone already knew about.
