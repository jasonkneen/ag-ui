 * The TS SDK canonicalises provider stop reasons to camelCase (see
 * `dist/src/models/bedrock.js`, which maps Bedrock's `content_filtered` to
 * `contentFiltered`); Python forwards the provider spelling untouched. The
 * hint event carries Python's spelling from both bridges so a client matches
 * one value, not one per language. `StopReason` widens to `string`, so a model
 * that hands the provider value straight through is keyed here too.
 *
 * A `Map` and not an object literal, because the key arrives from the provider:
 * an object literal answers `toString` / `constructor` / `valueOf` /
 * `__proto__` off `Object.prototype`, and an inherited function passes a
 * truthiness guard and puts a `stop_reason` that is not a stop reason on the
 * wire.
 *
 * `maxTokens` stays keyed so this is a literal mirror of Python's tuple, which
 * lists `max_tokens`. The entry is dead on both bridges for the same reason:
 * the layer under the adapter raises before a token-limit truncation can reach
 * a terminal result (`MaxTokensError` from `Model.streamAggregated` here,
 * `MaxTokensReachedException` from `event_loop` there).
 *
 * Any reason absent from the table carries no hint. That covers the normal
 * `endTurn` and `toolUse`, the other stops Python's tuple has no entry for
 * (`cancelled`, `stopSequence`, `interrupt` and `modelContextWindowExceeded`,
 * the last of which Python's own `StopReason` does not spell at all) and a
 * provider value forwarded untranslated such as Anthropic's `refusal`.
 * Mirroring runs one way: where Python has no counterpart value, this stays
 * silent rather than inventing one.

/**
 * SDK error names that must not be reported as a forced stop, keyed by

 *
 * Python does not split this by exception type but by WHERE the exception was
 * raised. On `strands-agents` 1.52.0, the release this taxonomy was verified
 * against, `_handle_model_execution` yields `ForceStopEvent` for anything that
 * escapes the model call itself once no hook has asked for a retry, so a
 * provider failure raised inside that call reports as a forced stop. The two
 * raises that happen AFTER the model call returned normally,
 * `MaxTokensReachedException` and `StructuredOutputException`, are re-raised by
 * `event_loop_cycle` without a `ForceStopEvent` and reach the Python adapter's
 * outer handler, which reports `STRANDS_ERROR`. These are those two TS
 * analogues, rethrown so they reach this adapter's outer handler and keep the
 * same code.
 *
 * That first sentence is a statement about 1.52.0 and not about every release
 * the Python sibling supports. On 1.15.0, 1.18.0 (what its `uv.lock` pins) and
 * 1.20.0 the same `except` is gated behind an exhausted
 * `ModelThrottledException`, and every other exception is re-raised with no
 * `ForceStopEvent` at all, so a provider 5xx reports `STRANDS_ERROR` there
 * while it reports `STRANDS_FORCE_STOP` here. This adapter carries no version
 * branching for that and is not going to: it mirrors current Python. See
 * `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the releases that were driven to establish it.
 *
 * `ContextWindowOverflowError` is deliberately absent even though Python lists
 * `ContextWindowOverflowException` in the same re-raise tuple: providers raise
 * it from inside the model call, where the force-stop handler catches it first.
 * The TS SDK raises its counterpart from the provider too (`bedrock.js`,
 * `anthropic.js` and `google/model.js` all raise it while translating a
 * model-call failure), so the forced-stop default is the matching report.
 *
 * Matched on `name`, which the SDK sets explicitly in every constructor
 * (`dist/src/errors.js`), rather than by `instanceof`: name matching survives a
 * duplicated SDK copy in the dependency tree and needs no value import of a
 * peer dependency. Never on a version string.

 *    has seen — the same class of bug as Python re-emitting `ModelMessageEvent`
 *    after the text has already streamed:
 *      - `agentResultEvent`  — terminal result; already `RUN_FINISHED`.
 *      - `modelMessageEvent` — the assembled assistant message, already streamed
 *                              as `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `TOOL_CALL_*`.
 *      - `toolResultEvent`   — already mapped from `afterToolCallEvent` to
 *                              `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`.
 *      - `messageAddedEvent` — framework-side history bookkeeping; the client's

 *
 * Deliberately NOT skipped — these carry information no mapped AG-UI event
 * conveys, which is exactly what the RAW fallback exists for (issue #2291):
 *   - `modelMetadataEvent`  — token usage and latency metrics, which the AG-UI
 *                             event set has no equivalent for.
 *   - `modelRedactionEvent` — a guardrail redaction notice. Losing it silently
