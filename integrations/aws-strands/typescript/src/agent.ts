 * Events the RAW fallback deliberately stays silent about.
 *
 * Two groups, both of which would be noise rather than new information:
 *
 * 1. Lifecycle/plumbing brackets. The TS SDK surfaces hook brackets the Python
 *    `stream_async` generator never emits, so these are the TS counterpart of
 *    Python's `init_event_loop` / `start_event_loop` / `start` skips: they carry
 *    no payload of their own and only bracket work already reported by mapped
 *    events.
 *
 * 2. Payload-carrying events whose payload is *already* on the wire under a
 *    mapped AG-UI event. Forwarding these as RAW duplicates content the client
 *    has seen — the same class of bug as Python re-emitting `ModelMessageEvent`
 *    after the text has already streamed:
 *      - `agentResultEvent`  — terminal result; already `RUN_FINISHED`.
 *      - `modelMessageEvent` — the assembled assistant message, already streamed
 *                              as `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `TOOL_CALL_*`.
 *      - `toolResultEvent`   — already mapped from `afterToolCallEvent` to
 *                              `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`.
 *      - `messageAddedEvent` — framework-side history bookkeeping; the client's
 *                              history comes from `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT skipped — these carry information no mapped AG-UI event
 * conveys, which is exactly what the RAW fallback exists for (issue #2291):
 *   - `modelMetadataEvent`  — token usage and latency metrics, which the AG-UI
 *                             event set has no equivalent for.
 *   - `modelRedactionEvent` — a guardrail redaction notice. Losing it silently
 *                             would leave a client unable to tell redacted
 *                             output from an ordinary short answer.
 *
 * Everything else falls through to a RAW event.
