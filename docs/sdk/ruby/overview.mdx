The AG-UI Ruby SDK provides a robust and idiomatic way to connect Ruby applications to AG-UI agents. It enables real-time streaming communication through Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing you to build intelligent agent-powered applications with Ruby.

## Installation

Install the SDK using Ruby's standard package management:

```bash
bundle add ag-ui-protocol
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example showing how to create and encode an event:

```ruby
require "ag_ui_protocol"

def send_message(message_id, content, stream)
    encoder = AgUiProtocol::Encoder::EventEncoder.new

    text_message_start_event = AgUiProtocol::Core::Events::TextMessageStartEvent.new(
        message_id: message_id,
    )
    text_message_start_event_sse = encoder.encode(text_message_start_event)
    stream.write(text_message_start_event_sse)

    text_message_content_event = AgUiProtocol::Core::Events::TextMessageContentEvent.new(
        message_id: message_id,
        delta: content,
    )
    text_message_content_event_sse = encoder.encode(text_message_content_event)
    stream.write(text_message_content_event_sse)

    text_message_end_event = AgUiProtocol::Core::Events::TextMessageEndEvent.new(
        message_id: message_id,
    )
    text_message_end_event_sse = encoder.encode(text_message_end_event)
    stream.write(text_message_end_event_sse)
end
```

## Package Structure

The Ruby SDK is organized into several focused packages, each handling a specific aspect of the AG-UI protocol:

### Core Package (`AgUiProtocol::Core`)
The foundation of the SDK, providing event types, interfaces, and decoding capabilities. This package defines all the event structures used in AG-UI communication, including text messages, tool calls, state management, and lifecycle events.

```ruby
require "ag_ui_protocol/core/events"
require "ag_ui_protocol/core/types"
```

### Encoding Package (`AgUiProtocol::Encoder::EventEncoder`)
Provides flexible encoding for events to SSE. Includes JSON encoding, SSE writing for servers, and content negotiation for handling different MIME types.

```ruby
require "ag_ui_protocol/encoder/event_encoder"
```
