# Parallel flight/dashboard regression traces (PNI-490)

These are recorded protocol traces, not hand-authored tool sequences. Both tools
belong to the same native assistant message and retain its `parentMessageId`.
Only the run boundaries and `search_flights` / `render_a2ui` events are retained;
transport debug metadata, import provenance, timestamps and unrelated tools are
removed. Call IDs, parent message IDs, argument chunks, result payloads and event
order are preserved.

- `langgraph-live.json`: a fresh provider-backed synthetic demo, generated through
  an aimock recorder on 2026-09-24 with LangGraph 1.1.6, LangChain 1.2.15,
  langchain-openai 1.1.9, copilotkit Python 0.1.94 and ag-ui-langgraph 0.0.41.
  The native SQLite checkpoint contains one assistant message with both parallel
  calls. The graph exposes the existing Beautiful Chat `search_flights` and a
  direct `render_a2ui` tool, with `parallel_tool_calls=True`. Two model requests
  were recorded (parallel tool turn, then completion).
- `langgraph-import.json`: that same saved native history, passed through the
  Intelligence LangGraph normalizer and shared conversation-event builder.
- `strands-ts-import.json`: the retained original Strands SDK 1.19.0 native
  SessionManager snapshot, passed through Intelligence PR1366's normalizer and
  the same event builder. This original source used a deterministic model and
  real Agent/FunctionTool/SessionManager execution; it is not a provider-generated
  Strands conversation.

The LangGraph model emitted exactly the original Strands fixture's flight and
render argument values. Both transformations use the custom
`copilotkit://app-dashboard-catalog`. The original Strands capture used generic
FunctionTool callbacks, so its tool-schema validation is not claimed equivalent
to the typed LangGraph tools. The regression concerns preserved sibling call
identity and result ownership, downstream of those schema differences.

Published CopilotKit 1.73.3 with A2UI middleware 0.0.10 maps the dashboard to the
flight call in all three traces, then suppresses the flight result. Each trace
must instead produce the dashboard on its render call and flight cards on their
own flight call. Existing recovery tests cover the legacy nested-render path
where adapters omit parent message IDs. Separate synthetic unit events exercise
out-of-order ordinary results and failure envelopes.

## Parallel-call limitation

Sibling detection requires matching, nonempty `parentMessageId` values on both
`TOOL_CALL_START` events. If an adapter omits either parent ID, the middleware
retains the legacy nesting fallback, so independent parallel calls may still
share an activity or have their output suppressed. Adapters should preserve the
originating assistant message ID on each sibling call.
