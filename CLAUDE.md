# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

### TypeScript SDK (Main Development)
```bash

# Install dependencies (using pnpm)
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run development mode
pnpm dev

# Run linting
pnpm lint


# Run type checking
pnpm check-types

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Format code
pnpm format

# Clean build artifacts
pnpm clean

# Full clean build
pnpm build:clean
```

### Python SDK
```bash
# Navigate to python-sdk directory
cd python-sdk

# Install dependencies (using poetry)
poetry install

# Run tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Build distribution
poetry build
```

### Running Specific Integration Tests
```bash
# For TypeScript packages/integrations
cd packages/<package-name>
pnpm test

# For running a single test file
cd packages/<package-name>
pnpm test -- path/to/test.spec.ts
```

## High-Level Architecture

AG-UI is an event-based protocol that standardizes agent-user interactions. The codebase is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

### Core Protocol Architecture
- **Event-Driven Communication**: All agent-UI communication happens through typed events (BaseEvent and its subtypes)
- **Transport Agnostic**: Protocol supports SSE, WebSockets, HTTP binary, and custom transports
- **Observable Pattern**: Uses RxJS Observables for streaming agent responses

### Key Abstractions
1. **AbstractAgent**: Base class that all agents must implement with a `run(input: RunAgentInput) -> Observable<BaseEvent>` method
2. **HttpAgent**: Standard HTTP client supporting SSE and binary protocols for connecting to agent endpoints
3. **Event Types**: Lifecycle events (RUN_STARTED/FINISHED), message events (TEXT_MESSAGE_*), tool events (TOOL_CALL_*), and state management events (STATE_SNAPSHOT/DELTA)

### Repository Structure
- `/sdks/typescript/`: Main TypeScript implementation
  - `/packages/`: Core protocol packages (@ag-ui/core, @ag-ui/client, @ag-ui/encoder, @ag-ui/proto)
- `/integrations/`: Framework integrations (langgraph, mastra, crewai, etc.)
- `/apps/`: Example applications including the AG-UI Dojo demo viewer
- `/sdks/python/`: Python implementation of the protocol
- `/docs/`: Documentation site content

### Integration Pattern
Each framework integration follows a similar pattern:
1. Implements the AbstractAgent interface
2. Translates framework-specific events to AG-UI protocol events
3. Provides both TypeScript client and Python server implementations
4. Includes examples demonstrating key AG-UI features (agentic chat, generative UI, human-in-the-loop, etc.)

### State Management
- Uses STATE_SNAPSHOT for complete state representations
- Uses STATE_DELTA with JSON Patch (RFC 6902) for efficient incremental updates
- MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT provides conversation history

### Multiple Sequential Runs
- AG-UI supports multiple sequential runs in a single event stream
- Each run must complete (RUN_FINISHED) before a new run can start (RUN_STARTED)
- Messages accumulate across runs (e.g., messages from run1 + messages from run2)
- State continues to evolve across runs unless explicitly reset with STATE_SNAPSHOT
- Run-specific tracking (active messages, tool calls, steps) resets between runs

### Development Workflow
- Nx is used for monorepo build orchestration
- Each package has independent versioning
- Integration tests demonstrate protocol compliance
- The AG-UI Dojo app showcases all protocol features with live examples

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- When answering questions about the repository, use the `nx_workspace` tool first to gain an understanding of the workspace architecture where applicable.
- When working in individual projects, use the `nx_project_details` mcp tool to analyze and understand the specific project structure and dependencies
- For questions around nx configuration, best practices or if you're unsure, use the `nx_docs` tool to get relevant, up-to-date docs. Always use this instead of assuming things about nx configuration
- If the user needs help with an Nx configuration or project graph error, use the `nx_workspace` tool to get any errors
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
